= Introduction =

Because L2Packets library uses OpenSLL crypto API, you will need OpenSSL's libs for vc, built using *same C-Runtime* as L2Packets uses. 
_(L2Packets uses Multi-Threading CRT in Release build (/MT), and Multi-Threading Debug CRT in Debug build (/MTd))._


= Details =

To compile OpenSSL with Visual Studio, download sources from http://www.openssl.org. Run something like _Start -> All Programs -> MS Visual Studio -> Tools -> Visual Studio Command Promt_. There cd into *folder_with_openssl_sources\ms* and run
 {{{
do_masm.bat
 }}}
After Makefile appears (nt.mak), cancel build. Open nt.mak, edit CFLAGS/CPPFLAGS var: change /MD to /MT :) Then run
 {{{
nmake -f nt.mak clean
nmake -f nt.mak
 }}}
