#summary Compile guide
= Supported OS compilers =
Now L2Packets only supports Win32/
Currently 2 ways of compiling are ready: [http://www.mingw.org/ Mingw32] and [http://www.microsoft.com/express/ Visual C++].


= Mingw32 =
Download source archive, in console cd into subdir *project_mingw32*, execute:
 {{{> make_release}}}
or
 {{{> mingw32-make -s -f Makefile_release.mingw32}}}
Result static library will be in folder *dist/Release/mingw32*.

= Visual C++ =
In folder *project_vc2005express* open file !L2Packets.sln with Visual Studio, choose build configuration *Release|Win32*, and build solution. Result static library will be in folder *dist/Release/vc2005*.
Debug build by default uses /MTd (Multi-threaded debug) C runtime, release - /MT.

= sqlite3 compile warnings =
Yes, during build you will see lots of warnings in file sqlite3.c. sqlite devs think it is normal, see [http://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q17 (17) I get hundreds of compiler warnings when I compile SQLite. Isn't this a problem? Doesn't it indicate poor code quality?]
